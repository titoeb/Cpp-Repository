Main things to do:
    -> Add the print method in the hex class.

    -> Write a print funciont for the board

    -> Implement stupid AI as function in hex:
        -> Choose a random field to put the point in.

    -> Add the gameplay into the play_hex function:
        -> While the game is not won
            -> Show the board
            -> Ask the player to move in the console
            -> Let the AI take its next move
        -> if the game is won:
            -> Print out the winner

    -> Implement "find longest path in the graph"-function in hexgraph class.
    
    -> Write a better version of the AI: Append longest path towards opposite side
        -> What to do if move is impossible?
