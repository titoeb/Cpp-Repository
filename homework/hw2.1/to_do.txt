Main things to do:
    -> Implement stupid AI as function in hex:
        -> Needs to be faster
    
    -> Faster algorithm to find whether opposited sides are connect
        -> Simply brute forcing all options is not fast enough.
    
    -> Write a better version of the AI: Append longest path towards opposite side
        -> What to do if move is impossible?
