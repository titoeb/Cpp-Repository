Main things to do:
    -> Implement stupid AI as function in hex:
        -> Needs to be faster

    -> Before optimizing, Profile the program to the find the true bottleneck.
        -> Faster algorithm to find whether opposited sides are connect
            -> Simply brute forcing all options is not fast enough.
            -> alternative:
                -> Remove inner loop and adapt is_connect to compare to hash lookup of all nodes.
    
    -> Write a better version of the AI: Append longest path towards opposite side
        -> What to do if move is impossible?
