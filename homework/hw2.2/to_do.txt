Main things to do:
    -> Implement stupid AI as function in hex:
        -> Needs to be faster

    -> Before optimizing, Profile the program to the find the true bottleneck.
        -> Faster algorithm to find whether opposited sides are connect
            -> Simply brute forcing all options is not fast enough.
            -> Use the union algorithm or a specialized path algorithm
